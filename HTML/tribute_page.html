      <h2 class="about">About Lionel Messi</h2>
      <p>
        Lionel Andrés Messi, (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi],
        born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine
        professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris
        Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team. Often considered
        the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest
        players of all time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards, a
        record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon
        d'Or Dream Team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, Central Argentina,
        Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, for whom he made
        his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. Growing up in a
        tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the
        sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers,
        Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi,
        both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he
        joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though
        his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother,
        Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly
        affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then,
        as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and
        pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother. He established
        himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years,
        and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008 to 2009 he helped
        Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged
        22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed,
        with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first
        player to win the award four times and in a row.[10] During the 2011 to
        2012 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals
        scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's
        all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second
        for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career
        rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014 to 2015 campaign,
        becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga (The Spanish Football
        League) and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which
        he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of
        Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon d'Or. Out of
        contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021

      <h2>Achievements on the field</h2>
      <h3>2003 to 2005: Rise to the first team</h3>
      <p>
        During the 2003 to 2004 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly
        progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record five youth
        teams in a single campaign.
      </p>

      <p>
        At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the
        youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.

        debut
      </aside>
      <h3>2005 to 2008: Becoming a starting eleven player</h3>
      <p>
        On 24 June, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a
        senior team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years
        less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150
        million
      </p>
      <aside>
        <q
          >In my entire life I have never seen a player of such quality and
          personality at such a young age, particularly wearing the 'heavy'
          shirt of one of the world's great clubs.</q
        >– Fabio Capello praises the 18-year-old Messi following the Joan Gamper
        trophy in August 2005
      </aside>
      <h3>2008 to 2009: First treble</h3>
      <p>
        With his team now under a new manger, he was the season's Champions
        League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's
        history, Messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4–0
        quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich.[87] He played as a false nine
        during the final on 27 May in Rome against Manchester United.
        <strong>
          Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2–0,
          the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van
          der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of
          Spanish football.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <h3>2009 to 2010: First Ballon d'Or</h3>
      <p>
        His team's prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as
        Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six
        top-tier trophies in a single year. At 22 years old, Messi won the
        Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times by
        the greatest voting margin in each trophy's history.
      </p>
      <h3>2010–11: Fifth La Liga title and third Champions League</h3>
      <p>
        Messi secured Barcelona's first trophy of the 2010–11 campaign, the
        Supercopa de España, by scoring a hat-trick in his side's second-leg 4–0
        victory over Sevilla, after a first-leg defeat. Assuming a playmaking
        role, he was again instrumental in a Clásico on 29 November 2010, the
        first with José Mourinho in charge of Real Madrid, as Barcelona defeated
        their rivals 5–0. Messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league
        victories, a record in Spanish football, concluding with another
        hat-trick against Atlético Madrid on 5 February 2011. His club
        performances in 2010 earned him the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or, an
        amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year
        award, though his win was met with some criticism due to his lack of
        success with Argentina at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Under the award's old
        format, he would have placed just outside the top three, owing his win
        to the votes from the international coaches and captains.For his efforts
        in 2011, he again received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the
        fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times.

      <h3>2012: A record-breaking year</h3>
      <p>
        As Messi developed into a combination of a number 8 (a creator), a 9
        (scorer), and a 10 (assistant), he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and
        provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011–12 season,
        producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions.As he also maintained his
        goalscoring form into the second half of the season, the year 2012 saw
        him break several longstanding records. On 7 March, two weeks after
        scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five
        times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer
        Leverkusen,
        <strong
          >an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.
        </strong>
        In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, he
        was also the top scorer with 14 goals. Two weeks later, on 20 March,
        Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old,
        overtaking a 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a
        hat-trick against Granada.

          >I feel sorry for those who want to compete for Messi's throne – it's
          impossible, this kid is unique.

            to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's
            children in the wake of the recent earthquake. He has since
            participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention,
            education, and the social inclusion of disabled children

            <strong>in 2007</strong>
            following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill
            children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the
            point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.

        <li>
          <p>
